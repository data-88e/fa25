Hi - I am a lecturer in Data Science and Economics as well as a staff member helping to build out Data Science Undergraduate Studies. I am passionate about how Data Science approaches can bring innovation to teaching and learning in all disciplines. I like making creative new curriculum, even if it comes out a little rough.
